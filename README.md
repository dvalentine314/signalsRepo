# SignalsRepo

I made this thing to play with signals. It's just a Vanilla Angular repo with some basic stuff in the `app.component.ts` to act as a playground. Enjoy if you want. might add more samples later. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0-next.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
